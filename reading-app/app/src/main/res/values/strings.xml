    <string name="A1"> Most people have a sponge or two in their kitchen. A sponge is handy for washing dishes and wiping counters. Most of our sponges are made by machines, out of wood fiber or plastic. But before man-made sponges were invented, people used natural sponges. A natural sponge is, in fact, an animal. It lives in the ocean. It has no eyes or mouth. It has no organs at all. It cannot swim. It is anchored to a rock and feeds on the bacteria in the water that flows through it.</string>
    <string name="A2"> For hundreds of years, people in the Greek islands fished for sponges. A sponge diver dove from his boat wearing only a rope around his waist. He carried a heavy stone, which took him quickly to the ocean floor. He could hold his breath for three to five minutes at a time. He used a small curved knife to cut the sponges from the rocks. He took as many as he could before his breath ran out, and put them in a net bag.</string>
    <string name="A3">When diving suits were invented, sponge divers began to use them. The suits let them stay on the ocean floor longer. They could dive deeper. They brought up more sponges than they had been able to before. But the divers had to be careful to avoid decompression sickness, which could kill or injure them. Now there are very few sponge divers left. Most people use man-made sponges, which are cheaper. Also, the number of sponges living in the ocean has been reduced by pollution.</string>
    <string name="B1">There are many reasons we need to drink water. The cells in our bodies need it to help us live and grow. The water we drink gets rid of waste that we have inside of us. It also controls how hot or cool our body is. Water is in everything we eat and drink. We must replace the water that our body sweats out. It can make our skin dry and give us a headache.</string>
    <string name="B2">If we don\'t drink water it can make it hard for us to pay attention. Our body may also feel very tired. Without water, our body cannot fight off colds. Our body is more than half water. We can get dehydrated when we do not have enough water in our bodies.</string>
    <string name="B3">Water leaves our bodies in many ways. Some of these ways are when we use the bathroom and sweat. Playing sports and being outside in the heat for long periods of time can make our bodies sweat. When our body sweats it loses water. We can live for about fifty days without eating any food. We can only live a few days without drinking water. This is why we need to drink a lot of water.</string>
    <string name="C1">A tree is a tall plant that is made of wood. Trees can live for many, many years. A tree has roots, a trunk, branches, and leaves. The roots are underground, but sometimes you can see them sticking out of the dirt. The roots help to keep the tree in place and they also get the food that the tree needs from the soil in the ground. The roots send the food to the trunk. The trunk is like a water pipe. It carries the food to the branches for the leaves.</string>
    <string name="C2">Some trees never lose their leaves and their leaves always stay green. These trees are called evergreen. The leaves on most other trees change colors when the seasons change. In the autumn you will see red, yellow and orange leaves. In the winter, you will see a lot of trees without any leaves at all.</string>
    <string name="C3">Leaves change colors because the tree does not get a lot of light from the sun. Trees need to save some food to live when there is not much sun and so they cannot give it all to the leaves. The leaves cannot live without the food and that is why they fall off.</string>
    <string name="D1">The girl crouched barefoot on the moving raft. The boy stood silent and pushed it along in the slow current with a long bamboo pole. Mountains rose on all sides. The mountains were green close by, blue far off. Monkeys howled in the trees. Mist rose in soft waves from the river. The boy wiped drops of rain from his face with a sleeve of his white linen shirt. His hair was soaked, and so was the shirt. He leaned on the bamboo pole with all of his strength.</string>
    <string name="D2">Whenever he pushed, he let out a grunt. And each time he pushed, the boat surged forward on the river. There was no other sound but the howling of monkeys, and rain pattering quietly on the dark river. The girl meantime crouched in silence, peering off into the jungle. She was shivering. She pulled the colorful shawl tighter over her bony shoulders. Her dark earlobes were beaded with rainwater.</string>
    <string name="D3">The boy did not know where he was pushing this raft to on the dark, misted river in a deep jungle under the cold and incessant rain. The girl had an idea of where they might end up together, if only the boy was strong and patient enough to keep on pushing the raft, but she didn\'t speak even a word about it.</string>
    <string name="E1">My mom always tells me that honesty is the best policy. I wasn\'t quite sure what she meant by that until I found some money the other day. I was walking home from school when I saw a bag in the street. I could tell that something was in it, but I wasn\'t sure what. I walked over to the bag, picked it up, and then walked back to the sidewalk. It was heavy and lumpy. I opened it up and in it was stacks of money. I had never seen so much money before!</string>
    <string name="E2">I was baffled because I didn\'t know where it came from. I wanted to go to the store and spend it. I thought about the things I could buy with all this money. I stuffed it in my book bag and ran home. I wasn\'t sure if I should tell my mom or hide it in my room and spend a little at a time so no one would notice. I thought about what my mom always says about being honest. What if someone stole this money and the cops are looking for it?</string>
    <string name="E3">So, I went into the family room and told my mom about my recent discovery. Then I showed her the bag of money. We drove to the police station and turned it in. They said that the money was stolen and that I did the right thing. Three days later the police contacted my mom and told her to bring me to the police station to collect the reward money. It was a lot less money than had been in the bag, but I felt good about what I\'d done and I was happy to be able to spend it without feeling guilty.</string>
    <string name="F1">The sun was setting now. The whole beach was empty except for a few seagulls. It was low tide and waves were rolling in slowly and breaking in long curves of surf. Tommy and Linda and their parents had retired to their tent after a wonderful afternoon of swimming and eating sandwiches and drinking lemonade on the beach. It had been hot that day, and they were all tired. They would go out on the beach again tomorrow. Their father had already promised to help the two children build a sand castle the next day. But that was tomorrow.</string>
    <string name="F2">Right now, they sat by their campfire and watched as the sun sank into the sea. As waves rushed up the beach they made a hissing sound on the hard, cold, wet sand. Then the waves hissed again as they withdrew, leaving trails of small bubbles behind. One after another the bubbles popped. It got colder as the sun sank, coloring the sea red. Some of the gulls were crying cree cree cree!</string>
    <string name="F3">Tommy shivered, grateful for the fire\'s heat. Linda shivered, too, but more because the seagulls sounded so sad in the quickly darkening evening. She was glad for the fire\'s light. Two small gulls with black heads and speckled bodies walked up and down nervously at the tide line where the waves were foaming and hissing. Another gull stood still and silent, just looking out at the thin evening clouds and the darkening sea. It reminded Linda of herself.</string>
    <string name="G1">Breathing in brings oxygen into our bodies. Oxygen is a colorless, odorless gas that makes up over twenty percent of the earth\'s atmosphere. It makes up over sixty percent of the human body. Oxygen helps the cells in our bodies make energy. When we inhale, we pull air through our noses or mouths into our lungs. Then it travels through a series of branching tubes to arrive at tiny air sacs. The sacs are covered in tiny blood vessels. The oxygen from the air we breathe passes into the blood stream through these tiny blood vessels. The blood, rich with oxygen, then travels to the heart. The heart pumps it to the rest of the body. Not only does breathing bring something we need into our bodies, it also removes waste.</string>
    <string name="G2">When we exhale, we get rid of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a gas produced by cells when they change nutrients into energy. It leaves the body by the same route that oxygen comes in, but in reverse. From the blood, it goes to the tiny blood vessels around the air sacs in our lungs. From the sacs, it goes through the branching tubes in the lungs. From the lungs, it is pushed out of the mouth or nose into the air.</string>
    <string name="G3">In the air, carbon dioxide is available to plants, who need it the way humans and animals need oxygen. Breathing is so important to our lives that we mostly do it without trying. We can learn to control our breathing to some extent. But we mostly breathe without even being aware that we are doing so. Just imagine if you had to think about breathing every time you took a breath!</string>
    <string name="H1">Humans have made and used tools for thousands of years. We have simple tools like screws, wedges, ramps, pulleys, wheels, and levers. We\'ve gotten so good at making and using tools that we\'ve made robots that can create and make tools! However, humans aren\'t the only animals to use tools. There are some tame animals that can use tools because we teach them to do so. For example, many people use service animals to help them around the house. Most service animals are dogs, but can also be cats, birds, miniature horses, or even pigs! The owners of these animals can teach them to use tools to open doors, turn on electronic devices, or call for help.</string>
    <string name="H2">There are other animals in the wild that learn to use natural objects as tools to meet a certain need. Although most animals don\'t use tools in this way, there is evidence that dolphins, otters, monkeys, apes, rodents, octopuses, elephants, and some birds can and do use tools in the wild. Many times, wild animals use tools for food. They can use the tools to either catch the food or to open it. Dolphins have been known to use sea sponges to stir up sand at the bottom of the ocean. This helps them uncover food.</string>
    <string name="H3">Crows have been recorded dropping stones into a water pitcher to raise the water level. This makes the water level high enough for them to reach. Various monkeys have been known to use sticks to reach into logs and ant hills to get ants to eat. Otters, on the other hand, use tools to open their food. Otters love to eat clams and mussels. But the meat of the clams and mussels is hidden inside shells. So, otters use rocks to hammer open the shells. Of course, people are still the most advanced tool users. But imagine an otter using a blender to make a clam smoothie!</string>
    <string name="I1">In the evening, Jasper heard the sound of a hammer knocking in nails, and the skid of an electric drill. He looked out his window, but he could not see where the sounds were coming from. They continued into the night, after he went to bed. In the morning, when Jasper left his house to walk to school with his dad, he saw a kind of shed, that hadn\'t been there the day before, on the side of his neighbor\'s house. The walls were made of plywood and two-by-fours. There were window holes cut into the walls.</string>
    <string name="I2">Mr. Wiseman, their neighbor, was standing on a ladder, and making a roof out of a blue plastic tarp and a length of willow fencing over the top of the shed. He nodded at Jasper and his dad as they passed by. As they walked along, Jasper and his dad saw a second shed, and then a third and a fourth. By the time they had arrived at school, they had seen ten. "What are those?" Jasper asked his dad. Jasper\'s dad explained that they were sukkah, special huts built by Jewish families to celebrate the harvest festival called Sukkot.</string>
    <string name="I3">During the festival, the families build and decorate their sukkah, and then invite their friends and relatives to visit them and share meals inside. In the afternoon, on his way home from school, Jasper noticed more sukkah. He saw Jewish fathers and their older children working together to build with wood and nails. He saw Jewish mothers and their babies and small children watching the walls go up. When he went to bed that night, he heard the construction sounds, and told himself, "It\'s the sound of the sukkah."</string>
    <string name="J1">One day when Helen Keller was nearly two years old, she developed a raging fever. By the time she woke up from it days later, she had become blind and deaf. Helen\'s parents couldn\'t speak to her or show her anything. They had no way to teach Helen, and Helen had no way to communicate. Helen grew frustrated and threw violent tantrums, stamping and screaming. Once, in a furious rage, she tipped over her little sister\'s crib. Helen\'s parents were deeply concerned. They hired Anne Sullivan, a young teacher, to try to communicate with their troubled and angry daughter.</string>
    <string name="J2">Sullivan had a unique approach to trying to teach Helen. She would use her finger to spell out words on the palm of Helen\'s hand and then place Helen\'s hand on objects. For instance, she would spell out tree and then place Helen\'s hand on a tree. For a long time, Helen did not seem to understand. Then one day, Sullivan put one of Helen\'s hands under streaming water and traced the letters for water onto Helen\'s other hand. Sullivan did this rapidly, over and over.</string>
    <string name="J3">Helen stood still, absorbed in the rapid movements of Sullivan\'s fingertip on one hand and the rushing of the water on her other hand. Then, like mist burning away in sunlight, she smiled as she came to understand that the word water was the name for the wonderful cool something flowing over her other hand. Helen let out a shriek of joy. But this was only the beginning. That afternoon, Helen learned more than a dozen new words. Before long, she also learned to read books printed in Braille, a system of raised dots that could be used to read by touch instead of by sight. After many years, Helen became a world-famous author.</string>
    <string name="K1">Sloths and monkeys are two types of mammals that live in South America. There are many similarities and differences between sloths and monkeys. Both sloths and monkeys generally live in middle latitudes that tend to be tropical. Both sloths and monkeys like to live in trees and climb around the canopy. They both tend to eat plant material, but occasionally eat insects. Because they are both mammals, they both have furry bodies. Many people think that sloths and monkeys are closely related, but they are quite different. Although both sloths and monkeys live in South America, monkeys can also be found on other continents like Africa and Asia. Also, there are even monkeys that live in snow.</string>
    <string name="K2">Although both sloths and monkeys live in the trees, sloths move very slowly. It is one of their defining characteristics. Monkeys, on the other hand, tend to move quickly from branch to branch. Also, sloths tend to move around by hanging upside down from branches whereas monkeys walk on top of branches. Sloths are able to hang upside down because of their long claws. Monkeys don\'t have claws like sloths, but they generally do have long tails that provide balance when walking on branches. Sloths don\'t have tails like monkeys.</string>
    <string name="K3">Finally, sloths are often considered lazy because they are so slow and sleep so much. In fact, "sloth" can be a synonym of lazy; people sometimes accuse lazy people of being sloths. One sloth, the pale-throated sloth, moves so slowly that algae grows on its fur and it turns green!</string>
    <string name="L1">Tensions are running high in the Groff home as talks on summer bedtime rules continue. The household is evenly divided into two camps. So far, there is no sign that either side will surrender. At eight o\'clock this evening, the younger Groffs, Ben and Lu, brought their demands to their parents. It appears they had been organizing for some time and were prepared for a fight. They asked for a later bedtime.</string>
    <string name="L2">They said they ought to be allowed to stay up until ten o\'clock in the summer. In support of their request, they pointed to the facts that they have no school in the morning and that it doesn\'t get dark until late in the summer. They also said that everyone else gets to stay up late and it\'s not fair. Their parents responded by offering an eight-thirty bedtime. This would be a half hour gain for the younger Groffs. The younger Groffs rejected this offer. They declared it so far below their original request as to be insulting. The mother of the Groff family gave a speech about the need of growing bodies for proper sleep. The father made a statement about the parents\' need to not have kids running around all night. </string>
    <string name="L3">The younger Groffs characterized the mother\'s speech as dumb. It was typical of their style, they claimed. They disapproved the father\'s words, calling them irrational, depicting events that would never happen. The issue remains unresolved. The younger Groffs\' skill at arguing could keep them out of bed until their desired bedtime. Should this occur, they could then claim they had been allowed to stay up late before, and so they should be allowed to stay up late again. If their parents can be convinced that a later bedtime has not caused a loss in quality behavior, they might back down. However, another possibility is that their parents are used to stalling tactics and will not be moved by them.</string>
    <string name="M1">Coyotes and wolves are both types of wild canines native to the United States. They are related. In some parts of the country, they have mixed to create a sub species called coywolf. While coyotes and wolves are similar animals, they are also different in many ways. While wolves once inhabited much of North America, they are now limited to wilderness areas. In the meantime, coyotes have spread from the western half of the country to the Southeast and Northeast.</string>
    <string name="M2">Unlike wolves, they do well living around humans and can even be found in cities. On average, wolves are much larger than coyotes. Coyotes have sharper ears and noses, while wolves have more rounded ears and bigger noses. While coyotes\' fur tends to be gray or brown, wolves can be grey, white, red, or black. Coyotes can run faster and longer than wolves. Both wolves and coyotes live in family units that include a mother, a father, and puppies. Coyote packs may expand temporarily to include unrelated adult and young coyotes for hunting, but wolf packs usually contain many families. Wolves hunt in packs to kill very large prey like bears or elk. Coyotes hunt in pairs and eat smaller prey such as rabbits, mice, and reptiles, though they may sometimes cooperate with other adults to kill larger mammals.</string>
    <string name="M3">Unlike wolves, coyotes will also eat fruits and vegetables. Coyotes and wolves are both important in Native American stories. Wolves usually symbolize strength and loyalty. Often, coyotes play the part of a trickster or one who breaks the rules in clever ways. Wolves and coyotes are similar animals, but subtle differences in behavior and living conditions make them different species.</string>
    <string name="N1">Soda, pop, soft drink, cola, seltzer -- these are all different names for the same drink that many people enjoy today. Whatever you call it, fizzy water has a unique history! What makes soda water unique is the carbonation. The carbonation comes from carbon dioxide. You may have heard of carbon dioxide before in science class. It is the chemical that people exhale when breathing. It is also the chemical that plants use as food. Companies add carbon dioxide to water through extreme pressure to make soda or seltzer water. But now you can make fizzy water at home, too. Hundreds of years ago, soda water was sold at pharmacies as a remedy. People believed that this fizzy water would solve all types of health problems. Pharmacists would mix the bubbly water with other drugs and flavors for their patients. We now know that soda water has no real health benefits.</string>
    <string name="N2">Although there is no real benefit from soda water, people grew to love the feel of the bubbles on their tongue. Now, soda water is popular around the world for non-medical reasons. Soda water is the same regardless of how it is used, but there are many different flavors that you can add to soda water. Originally, pharmacists would add flavors like lime, cherry, or even coffee to soda water. One of the first best selling flavors of soda was Dr. Pepper. Another early flavor was Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola was originally promoted to have health benefits that would restore strength. We now know that these claims are false. </string>
    <string name="N3">Companies aren\'t allowed to make false claims like this anymore. (Sometimes they still make false claims and can be sued.) Another problem with flavored sodas is that they contain a lot of sugar, which can lead to other health problems. Because of the health issues associated with too much sugar, cola companies started making diet versions of their soda. The first diet soda was a sugar-free ginger ale. Other diet sodas quickly came to market. Diet sodas have increased in popularity ever since. Today, however, many people are trying to choose healthier drinks such as tea, unflavored soda water, or even just plain water.</string>
    <string name="O1">My great-uncle Bradford and my great-aunt Marianne lived in a tin-roofed cabin on the sunny side of a steep hill. Throughout the county, they were renowned for the prize-winning vegetables their garden patch produced. One year, they grew a pumpkin as large as a five-year-old child is tall. Every spring, the neighbors came to beg for some of their tomato seeds, but, even using their seeds, no one grew tomatoes as deeply red and juicy as my great-aunt and uncle did. Some said it was luck that accounted for their success. Some swore Bradford was spraying his plants with some secret chemical formula. Bradford said it was his fiddle-playing on moonlit nights that caused the garden to flourish. Marianne always said, with a mysterious smile, "You just have to know how."</string>
    <string name="O2">One summer, at the end of August, when Bradford and Marianne were out in the garden with their harvesting baskets, Marianne discovered an enormous zucchini hiding under some leaves. It was much too large to fit in her basket. It was already bigger than a newborn baby. Well, let\'s just see how big it gets, Marianne said to herself. A week later, when they went to check on the zucchini, it was the size of a year-old piglet. Bradford wanted to bring it in, but Marianne convinced him to leave it on the vine just a little bit longer. The following week, it was the size of a young calf. Then, it was the size of the calf\'s cud-chewing mother.</string>
    <string name="O3">Finally, in October, they decided to pick it before the frost came. By then, it was the size of a recreational vehicle. Its growth had already knocked down the garden fence, and it was starting to threaten the side of the house. It took an axe to chop the stem, and two men on a cross-cut saw to slice the gigantic vegetable into manageable pieces. Marianne cut some pieces into slivers, which she put up in a pickle brine, and some other chunks she put into a wood chipper and used the pulp for zucchini bread. Here\'s my theory: the garden sits on a spot where an asteroid fell to earth, and the vegetables are nourished by extraterrestrial minerals.</string>
    <string name="P1">Crows are scavengers. The birds will eat almost anything, from vegetables and fruit, to nuts and seeds. They\'ll devour insects, frogs, lizards, mice, smaller birds, basically any animal they can fit into their mouths. And they\'ll happily pick at the flesh of carrion, which probably accounts for why ancient people associated crows with death. Crows are playful birds, very sociable with their own kind, and they live in large extended family groups. They frequently indulge in silly games, such as carrying a twig high into the air, dropping it, then quickly swooping down and catching it. They\'ve also been observed executing acrobatic backflips in flight.</string>
    <string name="P2">Though few species of crows migrate, very often, during the fall and winter months, the birds will congregate in large groups, known as roosts. These roosts may range from a few dozen crows to hundreds of thousands. One astonishingly large roost, recorded in Oklahoma, was estimated at over two million crows. Exactly why they gather in such large groups remains a mystery, though researchers suspect that the birds congregate for protection against predators, as well as to communicate with one another and exchange information about where to find food. Nearly all ornithologists (from the ancient Greek words ornis "bird" and logos "explanation") agree that crows are vastly intelligent creatures, with large brains in relation to their body size.</string>
    <string name="P3">Their intelligence is near the top of the avian world, alongside that of parrots. Their brains, at least in scale, are larger than human brains. A human brain is about one-and-a-half percent of body mass, while the brain of an American crow is more than two percent of its body mass. And like us, crows are toolmakers. For example, they\'ll use straight twigs to poke for grubs, and then use a hooked twig to pull the grub from its hiding place. Crows often drop nuts onto roads and rocky surfaces to crack them open. In Japan, the clever birds deposit walnuts at intersections, placing the nuts right in front of the wheel of a car. Then, after the car crushes the nut, the crows return to peck at the pieces.</string>
    <string name="Q1">Societies tend to function best when there are well-defined laws. Yet, even more important than the laws are the people who get to decide, enact, and enforce those laws. The people and structures that make those decisions are called government. Worldwide there are many types of government. These function at local, regional, and national levels. In all instances, government is the basis of power and control. But even when power is shared among people, problems arise. So, no form of rule is perfect.</string>
    <string name="Q2">An aristocratic government is power and control in the hands of a few people. Usually these people are thought to be different from the general population in some way. Ways in which aristocrats are thought to be different include: wealth, physical strength, intelligence, honor, technology, or achievement. A despotic government is absolute power and control in the hands of a single person or very small group. Despotic rulers often rule out of self-interest and ignore the desires of the people. They often come to power in one of two ways. First, they can inherit power from a relative—such as a king or queen. These are known as absolute monarchs or dictators. Second, a despotic government can seize power from their predecessors. This process is called a military coup. Often despotic governments are authoritarian or totalitarian. This means that the person or people in power try to control all aspects of life.</string>
    <string name="Q3">A democratic government is one in which people are involved in decision making. There are two main ways democracies function. One is direct democracy where people get to create, vote on, and enact laws on their own. The other is indirect democracy where citizen elect politicians to vote on and enact laws. Often in democracies a simple majority wins, but this can put people with minority viewpoints at a disadvantage. Anarchy is the opposite of government where a population is not ruled by any controlling body. In some senses, people view anarchy as disorder due to the lack of laws. However, for proponents of this form of "government", it removes all power structures. It makes individuals truly equal because it removes power from those with wealth, strength, merit, military arms, honor, and technology.</string>
    <string name="R1">Just a little over a century ago, the only way to enjoy music was to play it or listen to it in person. Then, with the discovery of radio waves and the invention of recording technology, people could enjoy music anytime. Today, digital recordings make enjoying music even easier and more portable than ever. However, the process of producing music has become more complex. Prior to the sale of the first compact disc, or CD, music was sold and listened to on wax cylinders, phonographs, vinyl records, or cassette tapes. Although most of these technologies are thought to be obsolete, you can still buy music in these formats. Prior to recording the music, musicians would thoroughly practice their songs. Then they would head to a recording studio.</string>
    <string name="R2">The musicians would want to make sure their songs were ready for recording because studio time can be expensive. Some musicians who had the equipment could record from their home or garage, but the sound quality would not be as good. Either way, the technology didn\'t allow for much post-recording editing as the technology does now. So, they had to make sure to minimize mistakes prior to recording. Finally, the musicians would have to be in-sync because everyone would play together in real time. Although decades in the making, digital music wasn\'t available for purchase in the United States until the late seventies when the first compact disc was sold. Digital music recording has changed how music is recorded, produced, and sold.</string>
    <string name="R3">With digital music, musicians no longer have to be physically together to play together. In fact, with pop music, musicians may never see each other—ever! In digital music, each part, voice, or instrument can be recorded on its own track. Usually, the first track is just a metronome or drum beat to keep time. Then, everyone records their own track when listening to that track and any other already-recorded track. Usually, the rhythm section lays the first music track. Then, basic chords and harmonies are added as the next track. Finally, the main melody is added. But a song isn\'t finished yet. The last step is for a producer to edit, enhance, and combine all the tracks into a final recording.</string>
